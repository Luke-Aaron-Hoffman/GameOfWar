    //What values for config: InfiniteTurnCount (int) | AceHigh (boolean) [True = Ace > King; False = Ace < 2] | ClassicColors (boolean) [True = Red/Black; False = 4 Color]
    //WarCount (int) [Amount of cards pulled during a war (not counting the card that actually fights)] | StackOnTop (boolean) [True = won cards go on top; False = won cards go on bottom]
    //InfiniteTurnCount is necessary, AceHigh is nice and simple, ClassicColors is a bit much and totally unnecessary
    //WarCount is a nice QOL feature, StackOnTop is nice since it's subjective where cards go. Alternatively, this could be a 3-way value that includes a "you pick" option. Save that for later.
